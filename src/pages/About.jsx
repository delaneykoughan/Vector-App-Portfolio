Spanning an impressive 200 acres, this conservation area is a verdant tapestry of towering trees, lush undergrowth, and vibrant wildlife. The woodland is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including the majestic Red Maple, the delicate Wild Carrot, and the robust Coltsfoot. The Sheep Laurel and Multiflora Rose add a splash of color to the landscape, while the Star-nose Mole and the Little Brown Bat represent some of the unique wildlife species that inhabit the area. The St. Margaret's Bay Area Woodland Conservation Site is not just a haven for wildlife, but also a living testament to our natural heritage. It is a place where the past meets the present, where the whispering winds carry stories of times long gone, and where every leaf and stone is a piece of history waiting to be discovered. Our Vision: We envision the St. Margaret's Bay Area Woodland Conservation Site as a thriving ecosystem, teeming with life and serving as a model for conservation efforts. We strive to create a space where nature can flourish, where future generations can experience the wonder of the woodland, and where the legacy of our natural heritage is safeguarded for years to come. Our Mission: Our mission is to preserve and enhance the ecological integrity of the St. Margaret's Bay Area Woodland Conservation Site. We are committed to protecting its diverse habitats, promoting sustainable use, and fostering an appreciation for our natural heritage through education and community engagement.`;
